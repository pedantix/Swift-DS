# DSAlg

This package came about as a support tool for my endeavors to become a better engineer via leetcode.This is a package that will evolve as I continue my refresher of college DS & Algs. That said Swift comes with an implementation of Array, Set and Dictionary. I am unlikely to reimplement those as that serves no function in solving engineering practice problems. The point of this project is to stay familiar with swift package manager and have a reference area to quickly copy and paste data structures into leet code to compete.

## Heap(Prority Queue)

A heap is a data structure to maintain a list of greatest or least element. The heap in this package is good for solving LC problems, but should not be used in production please instead use the Apple Containers library.
